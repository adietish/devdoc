== How to test new versions of Tycho 

Once in a while the tycho team post a request to test new versions of Tycho.

Here is how to do this easily without having to change all the projects pom.xml files.

=== Add tycho staging to .m2/settings.xml

Add this to your ~/.m2/settings.xml in the <profiles>:

   <profile>
      <id>tycho-staging</id>
      <pluginRepositories>
        <pluginRepository>
          <id>tycho-staged</id>
          <name>Staging repository for Tycho builds</name>
          <url>https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/orgeclipsetycho-240</url>
        </pluginRepository>
      </pluginRepositories>
   </profile>

The <url> is the only thing that changes - you get that from the emails asking to test staged Tycho builds.

Don't put it in activeProfiles.

=== Run mvn withy specific tychoVersion

And now you can without changing any of your pom's just run:

   $ mvn -DtychoVersion=0.18.0 -P tycho-staging clean install

And next time you want to test a new staging version of tycho you just go to your ~/.m2/settings.xml
and update the url.
